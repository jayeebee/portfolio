I wanted to include some interesting pictures and struggled to get the background to work but I believe it is mostly functional now.

I had some issues getting my spacing correct with my header and my other style boxes below, but they seem to be alright now.

The link for the work section for run buddy should work, the others simply lead to a picture as they are not complete or, the last two, even real. They should expand when focused.

The mobile optimization was a bit hard to do but I believe to to be functional.

The run-buddy.jpg image broke on the live website. Tried so many things before deleting the link and using VS to choose the link from assets and it worked. Literally looked just how I had typed it with a relative pathing. Not sure what happened.
