I wanted to include some interesting pictures and struggled to get the background to work but I believe it is mostly functional now.

I had some issues getting my spacing correct with my header and my other style boxes below, but they seem to be alright now.

The link for the work section for run buddy should work, the others simply lead to a picture as they are not complete or, the last two, even real. They should expand when focused.

The mobile optimization was a bit hard to do but I believe to to be functional.
